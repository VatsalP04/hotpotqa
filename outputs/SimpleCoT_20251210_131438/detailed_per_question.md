### Reasoning Chain
```
Let's break down the information step by step to answer the question:

1. **Dwarka**: The Wikipedia entry for Dwarka states that it is a city located on the western shore of the Okhamandal Peninsula in Gujarat, India. It also mentions that Dwarka is associated with the Dwarka Kingdom of Krishna and is a sacred Hindu pilgrimage site.

2. **Iqbal F. Qadir**: The Wikipedia entry for Iqbal F. Qadir mentions that he is a retired Pakistani admiral who participated in the second war with India (likely the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971). During this war, he was part of the flotilla that attacked the radar station in Dwarka, India.

3. **Mukachevo Radar Station**: This entry describes a Soviet radar station in Ukraine, which is unrelated to the attack on Dwarka. The mention of this station seems to be a red herring in the context of the question.

Now, combining the relevant information:
- The radar station attacked by Iqbal F. Qadir's flotilla was located in Dwarka, which is on the western shore of the Okhamandal Peninsula.
- The question asks what Iqbal F. Qadir was "on" when he participated in this attack. Given that he was a naval officer (Vice-Admiral) and part of a flotilla (a group of ships), it is logical to conclude that he was on a **ship** or

   - Released in 1983.
   - Stars Emilio Estevez.

2. **Wisdom (film)**:
   - Released in 1986.

3. **Here Not There (album)**:
   - Released in 1993.

From this, the only film starring Emilio Estevez in 1983 is *Nightmares*. There is no other film listed for that year.

However, the question asks for a film in the same year as *Nightmares* (1983), and the only film listed for Emilio Estevez in 1983 is *Nightmares* itself. This suggests there might be a misunderstanding or missing information in the provided data.

But if we consider the broader context (not just the provided Wikipedia snippets), Emilio Estevez also starred in *The Outsiders* (1983), which was released the same year as *Nightmares*.

Given the information strictly from the provided snippets, the answer would be that *

Answer: The Outsiders

## Question 16: 5a77897f55429949eeb29edc

- **Number of Retrieval Steps**: 1

### Reasoning Chain
```
Let's break down the information step by step to answer the question:

1. **Xylobands**: The wristbands were invented by Jason Regler, who got the idea during a Coldplay concert while listening to the song "Fix You."

2. **Talk Dirty (Jason Derulo song)**: This song is built around sampled instrumentals from "Hermetico" by the Israeli band Balkan Beat Box. The main saxophone lick in the song is based on Turkish traditional ornamentations, particularly the Turkish wind instrument called the **Zurna**.

3. **Connection to the Question**: The question asks about the instrument around which the song (that inspired Jason Regler) was built. From the information about "Talk Dirty," we know it is built around the **Zurna** (a Turkish wind instrument).

However, there is a potential confusion here. The question seems to imply that the song that inspired Jason Regler was "Talk Dirty," but the information about Xylobands states that the idea came during "Fix You" by Coldplay, not "Talk Dirty." This suggests a possible misinterpretation.

But if we strictly follow the question's phrasing and the information about "Talk Dirty," the answer is the **Zurna**.

**Final Answer**: The song was built around the **Zurna** (a Turkish wind instrument).

Answer: Zurna

To determine the name of Juan Manuel Márquez's younger brother who held a WBO championship, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Juan Manuel Márquez's Brother**: The text mentions that Rafael Márquez is Juan Manuel Márquez's older brother. However, the question asks for the younger brother. This seems contradictory, but let's verify:
   - Juan Manuel Márquez was born on August 23, 1973.
   - Rafael Márquez was born on March 25, 1975.
   - Thus, Rafael is the younger brother.

2. **Rafael Márquez's Titles**: The text states that Rafael Márquez held the IBF bantamweight title, the WBC, "Ring" magazine, and lineal super bantamweight titles, and the IBO bantamweight title. However, it does not explicitly mention the WBO title.

3. **Clarifying the WBO Title**: The text mentions that Rafael Márquez "challenged once for WBO featherweight title in 2011," but it does not state that he won it. Therefore, Rafael Márquez did not hold a WBO championship.

4. **Re-evaluating the Question**: The question asks for the name of Juan Manuel Márquez's younger brother who held a WBO championship. Since Rafael Márquez did not hold a WBO title, there might be a misunderstanding or error in the question.

### Reasoning Chain
```
Alright, let's tackle this question step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand the relationship between "Sporobolus" and "Zea" based on the information provided.

### Understanding the Terms

1. **Sporobolus**:
   - From the Wikipedia title, *Sporobolus* is a genus of plants in the grass family (Poaceae).
   - Specifically, *Sporobolus compositus* is a type of grass native to North America, known by names like "composite dropseed" or "tall dropseed."

2. **Zea**:
   - The name "Zea" appears in the context of "Leopoldo Zea Aguilar," a Mexican philosopher.
   - However, "Zea" is also a genus name in botany. For example, *Zea mays* is the scientific name for corn (maize).
   - Given that *Sporobolus* is a genus in the grass family, it's likely that "Zea" here refers to the botanical genus, not the philosopher's name.

### Connecting the Dots

Now, the question asks: "Sporobolus and Zea are in the same what?"

Given that both *Sporobolus* and *Zea* are genus names within the plant kingdom, and specifically within the grass family (Poaceae), the most straightforward answer is that they are in the same **family**.

But

Answer: family

### Reasoning Chain
```
To determine who Neleus of Scepsis studied under in addition to Theophrastus in the Peripatetic school, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Neleus of Scepsis** was a disciple of **Aristotle** and **Theophrastus**. This is explicitly stated in the first Wikipedia excerpt.
2. **Theophrastus** was the successor to Aristotle in the Peripatetic school, as mentioned in the third excerpt. This means that after Aristotle's death or departure, Theophrastus became the head of the school.
3. **Coriscus of Scepsis** (Neleus's father) was a student of **Plato** and a friend of Aristotle, as noted in the second excerpt. This suggests that Aristotle was active in the Peripatetic school during Coriscus's time, and likely during Neleus's time as well.

Given that Neleus was a disciple of both Aristotle and Theophrastus, and that Theophrastus succeeded Aristotle as head of the Peripatetic school, it is logical to conclude that Neleus studied under both philosophers during their respective tenures at the school.

### Final Answer:
Neleus of Scepsis studied under **Aristotle** and **Theophrastus** in the Peripatetic school.

Answer: Aristotle and Theophrastus.

Alright, let's tackle this question step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand which county's seat is 7 miles east of Trace State Park.

### Understanding the Question
The question asks: "Of what county is the city 7 miles east of Trace State Park the seat?"

In other words, we're looking for a county where its county seat (the main administrative city or town) is located 7 miles east of Trace State Park.

### Identifying Trace State Park
First, let's recall the information about Trace State Park from the provided Wikipedia snippet:

- **Trace State Park (formerly Old Natchez Trace Park)** is located off Mississippi Highway 6.
- It's approximately 7 miles east of Pontotoc and 7 miles west of Tupelo in Mississippi.

So, Trace State Park is situated between Pontotoc and Tupelo in Mississippi.

### Determining the County Seat
Now, we need to find out which city is 7 miles east of Trace State Park.

From the information:
- Trace State Park is 7 miles west of Tupelo.
- Therefore, Tupelo is 7 miles east of Trace State Park.

So, Tupelo is the city that is 7 miles east of Trace State Park.

### Identifying the County of Tupelo
Now, we need to determine which county Tupelo is the seat of.

From general knowledge (and this is a common fact about Mississippi):
- **Tupelo** is

Answer: Lee County

### Reasoning Chain
```
To determine the U.S. state where MedStar Georgetown University Hospital and Providence Hospital are located, let's analyze the information provided in the Wikipedia excerpts:

1. **MedStar Georgetown University Hospital**:
   - Located in the "Georgetown neighborhood of the Northwest Quadrant of Washington, D.C."
   - Affiliated with Georgetown University School of Medicine, which is in Washington, D.C.
   - Part of the MedStar Health network, which operates in the Washington, D.C. area.

2. **Providence Hospital (Washington, D.C.)**:
   - Located in the "District of Columbia."
   - Founded in 1861 and is the longest continuously operating hospital in the District.
   - A member of Ascension Health, a U.S.-based organization.

Both hospitals are explicitly mentioned to be in **Washington, D.C.**, which is a federal district (not a state) in the United States. However, if the question is interpreted as asking for the broader U.S. region or if "state" is being used loosely, Washington, D.C. is not part of any state but is a separate federal district.

If the question strictly requires a state name, the answer would be that neither hospital is in a U.S. state—they are in Washington, D.C. However, if the question is interpreted as asking for the broader metropolitan area (which includes parts of Maryland and Virginia), the answer would be that they are

### Reasoning Chain
```
To determine the year Jeffrey R. MacDonald, the subject of Joe McGinniss' 1983 book *Fatal Vision*, was convicted of murder, we need to look at the historical context of his case.

1. **Background of the Case**:
   - Jeffrey R. MacDonald was a U.S. Army Green Beret captain accused of murdering his pregnant wife and two young daughters in 1970. The crime occurred at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
   - He was initially acquitted in a 1979 court-martial but was later retried in a civilian court.

2. **Conviction Year**:
   - After the court-martial acquittal, the U.S. government pursued a civilian trial. MacDonald was eventually convicted of the murders in **1979** (the court-martial acquittal) and **1984** (the civilian trial). However, the civilian trial and conviction occurred after the publication of *Fatal Vision* (1983), which focused on the court-martial proceedings.

3. **Clarification**:
   - The question asks for the year of conviction, but the context of *Fatal Vision* (1983) centers on the 1979 court-martial, which ended in acquittal. The civilian trial conviction came later in 1984.

Given the phrasing of the question ("convict

```
To determine the religion of the composer for India's first science fiction film series, we need to identify the composer and then find information about their religion. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the first science fiction film series in India**:
   - From the "Krrish (franchise)" Wikipedia entry, we learn that the "Krrish" series is considered India's first science fiction film series.

2. **Identify the composer of the "Krrish" series**:
   - The same entry states that the films in the "Krrish" series were scored by Rajesh Roshan, who is the brother of Rakesh Roshan (the director and producer of the series).

3. **Find information about Rajesh Roshan's religion**:
   - Rajesh Roshan is a well-known Indian music director and composer. While the provided Wikipedia entries do not explicitly mention his religion, public knowledge about the Roshan family (which includes Rakesh Roshan, Hrithik Roshan, and Rajesh Roshan) indicates that they are of the Hindu faith. This is inferred from their names, cultural background, and the fact that they are part of the prominent Roshan family in Indian cinema, which is known to be Hindu.

Alright, let's tackle this question step by step. I'll start by identifying the key pieces of information from the provided Wikipedia entries and then connect the dots to find the answer.

### Understanding the Question
The question is: **"What year was the brother of this first round draft pick by the Washington Redskins drafted?"**

First, we need to identify who "this first round draft pick by the Washington Redskins" refers to. Then, we need to find out who his brother is and determine the year that brother was drafted.

### Identifying the First Round Draft Pick by the Washington Redskins
From the provided Wikipedia entries, we have three individuals mentioned as being drafted by the Washington Redskins in the first round:

1. **Champ Bailey**: Drafted by the Washington Redskins in the first round of the **1999 NFL Draft**.
2. **Ron Snidow**: Drafted by the Washington Redskins in the third round of the **1963 NFL Draft** (not first round).
3. **Jeris White**: Drafted by the Miami Dolphins in the second round of the **1974 NFL Draft** (not by the Redskins, and not first round).

So, the only first-round draft pick by the Washington Redskins among these three is **Champ Bailey in 1999**.

### Identifying Champ Bailey's Brother
From Champ Bailey's Wikipedia entry:
- "He is the brother of former NFL linebacker Boss Bailey."

So, Champ Bailey

- **Number of Retrieval Steps**: 1

### Reasoning Chain
```
To determine when the band that composed the instrumental piece "Discipline" was formed, we need to identify which band is associated with the composition.

1. The first mention of "Discipline" is a progressive rock band formed in 1987 by Matthew Parmenter. However, this band is known for their album "Unfolded Like Staircase" and is not associated with the instrumental piece "Discipline."

2. The second mention is "Catholic Discipline," a punk rock band formed in 1979. This band is also not associated with the instrumental piece "Discipline."

3. The third mention is the instrumental piece "Discipline" by the progressive rock band King Crimson. The description states that this piece is the title track of King Crimson's album "Discipline," which was their return album after a seven-year hiatus. This implies that the band was active before the hiatus and reformed to release this album.

To find the formation date of King Crimson, we would need to look up their history. King Crimson was originally formed in 1968 by Robert Fripp and Michael Giles, among others. The album "Discipline" was released in 1981, marking their return after a hiatus.

Thus, the band that composed the instrumental piece "Discipline" (King Crimson) was originally formed in 1968.

**Final Answer:** 1968.

Answer: 1968.

- **Number of Retrieval Steps**: 1

### Reasoning Chain
```
To determine whether the Sandy and Beaver Canal remained operational until a later date than the Los Angeles Aqueduct, we need to compare the operational periods of both.

1. **Sandy and Beaver Canal**:
   - Completed in 1848.
   - Ceased operation in 1852 due to the Cold Run Reservoir Dam failure.

2. **Los Angeles Aqueduct**:
   - The Los Angeles Aqueduct system began diverting Rush Creek in the **twentieth century** (i.e., after 1900).
   - The diversions were challenged in court in **1985**, and the court ordered LADWP to maintain higher flows in Rush Creek to protect trout populations. This implies the aqueduct was still operational and diverting water up to at least 1985.

**Comparison**:
- The Sandy and Beaver Canal operated from 1848 to 1852 (a total of 4 years).
- The Los Angeles Aqueduct was operational for much longer, with diversions continuing until at least 1985 (and likely beyond).

**Conclusion**:
The Los Angeles Aqueduct remained operational for a much longer period than the Sandy and Beaver Canal. Thus, the Sandy and Beaver Canal did **not** remain operational until a later date than the Los Angeles Aqueduct.

**Final Answer**: No, the Sandy and Beaver Canal did not remain operational until a later date than the

### Reasoning Chain

Alright, let's tackle this question step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand how many consecutive years the Serie A had been comprised of 18 teams when Hernán Crespo got injured.

### Understanding the Information Provided

1. **Serie A Composition in 2002–03 Season:**
   - The Wikipedia page for the 2002–03 Serie A season states that it was composed of 18 teams.
   - It also mentions that this was the 15th consecutive season (from 1988–89 to 2002–03) that Serie A had 18 teams.

2. **Hernán Crespo's Injury:**
   - The Wikipedia page for Hernán Crespo Toral provides his birth and death dates (December 8, 1937 – March 23, 2008).
   - However, there's no direct mention of when Hernán Crespo (the footballer) got injured. This seems to be a point of confusion because the name "Hernán Crespo Toral" refers to an Ecuadorian architect, not the footballer.

   **Clarification Needed:**
   - It appears there might be a mix-up between two individuals with similar names:
     - **Hernán Crespo Toral (1937–2008):** Ecuadorian architect.
     - **Hernán Crespo

Answer: The question seems to mix up two individuals. Hernán Crespo Toral (the architect) is unrelated to Serie A. The footballer Hernán Crespo's injury date isn't provided. Thus, the question cannot be answered with the given information.

### Reasoning Chain
```
Let's break down the information step by step to answer the question.

1. **Identify the British-made dance competition television series franchise**:
   - The first Wikipedia excerpt mentions "Dancing on Ice," which is described as a British-made dance competition television series franchise produced around the world.
   - The second excerpt confirms that Claudia Albertario appeared on "Dancing on Ice around the world."

2. **Verify the connection**:
   - The first excerpt states that "Dancing on Ice" is a British-made franchise, and the second excerpt explicitly mentions Claudia Albertario's appearance on it.

3. **Eliminate other possibilities**:
   - The third excerpt discusses "Strictly Come Dancing," another British dance competition, but there is no mention of Claudia Albertario in that context. Additionally, the question specifically asks about a British-made franchise, and "Dancing on Ice" is the one directly linked to Claudia Albertario.

Thus, the British-made dance competition television series franchise that Claudia Albertario appeared on is:

**Dancing on Ice**.

Answer: Dancing on Ice

### Reasoning Chain
```
To determine the population of the commuter village where the Robey-Peters Gun-Carrier was built at the 2001 census, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Robey-Peters Gun-Carrier**: The aircraft was built by Robey & Company Limited at Bracebridge Heath, Lincoln.
2. **Bracebridge Heath**: This is a suburb of Lincoln, but the question specifies a "commuter village." The provided Wikipedia titles do not mention Bracebridge Heath as a commuter village.
3. **Waddington, Lincolnshire**: This is a commuter village with a population of 6,086 at the 2001 census. However, the Robey-Peters Gun-Carrier was built in Lincoln, not Waddington.
4. **Newbold Verdon**: This is a commuter village in Leicestershire with a population of 3,193 at the 2001 census. However, it is not related to the Robey-Peters Gun-Carrier.

Since the question asks for the population of the commuter village where the Robey-Peters Gun-Carrier was built, and the only commuter village mentioned in the provided information is Waddington (even though it is not the correct location), there seems to be a mismatch. However, based on the given data, the closest answer is:

### Reasoning Chain
```
Let's break down the information step by step to answer the question.

1. **Identify the American in question**: The question refers to an American best known for his work on Disney animated films, specifically "Beauty and the Beast" and another film. From the first Wikipedia snippet, we learn that Kirk Wise is an American film director known for directing "Beauty and the Beast" and "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" (1996).

2. **Confirm the 1996 film**: The second Wikipedia snippet confirms that "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" is a 1996 American animated musical drama film directed by Kirk Wise (along with Gary Trousdale). The plot centers on Quasimodo, the deformed bell-ringer of Notre Dame.

3. **Connect the dots**: The question asks for the American (Kirk Wise) who is best known for "Beauty and the Beast" and a 1996 film whose plot centers on a character. From the snippets, that character is Quasimodo.

**Final Answer**: This American is best known for his work on such Disney animated films as "Beauty and the Beast" and a 1996 American animated musical drama film whose plot centers on **Quasimodo**.

Answer: Quasimodo

### Reasoning Chain
```
To determine the three other actresses who star in *Night Peacock* alongside Liu Yifei (also known as Crystal Liu), let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Wikipedia Title: Night Peacock** lists the main cast of the film, which includes:
   - Liu Yifei (Crystal Liu)
   - Liu Ye
   - Yu Shaoqun
   - Leon Lai

2. **Wikipedia Title: Liu Yifei** confirms that Liu Yifei is indeed the actress known as Crystal Liu.

3. **Wikipedia Title: Crystal Zhang** mentions Crystal Zhang (a different actress) but does not connect her to *Night Peacock*. This is a red herring in this context.

From the *Night Peacock* cast list, the three other actresses (or actors, since Leon Lai is male) who star alongside Liu Yifei are:
- Liu Ye
- Yu Shaoqun
- Leon Lai

However, the question specifically asks for *actresses*, so we exclude Leon Lai (a male actor). Thus, the three actresses are:
1. Liu Ye
2. Yu Shaoqun
3. (Note: The Wikipedia entry only lists one other female actress, Yu Shaoqun, alongside Liu Yifei. Liu Ye is male, and Leon Lai is male. There might be a discrepancy or missing information in the provided data.)

Given the data, the only confirmed

Answer: Yu Shaoqun, Liu Ye, Leon Lai (only Yu Shaoqun is an actress).

### Reasoning Chain
```
To determine the name of a land where Maria Anna of Spain's husband was king, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Maria Anna of Spain's Husband**: The text states that Maria Anna of Spain was married to **Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor**.
2. **Titles of Ferdinand III**: The text lists his titles as:
   - Holy Roman Emperor
   - King of Hungary
   - King of Bohemia

3. **Relevant Land**: Among these titles, the question asks for a land where he was king. The options are:
   - Hungary
   - Bohemia
   - (The Holy Roman Empire is not a single land but a collection of territories, so it is less likely to be the intended answer.)

4. **Most Likely Answer**: Both Hungary and Bohemia are valid answers, but if we consider the phrasing "a land," either would suffice. However, Hungary is often highlighted in historical contexts for its significance.

Thus, the name of a land where Maria Anna of Spain's husband was king is **Hungary** (or Bohemia, but Hungary is more commonly referenced).

**Final Answer**: Hungary.

Answer: Hungary.

### Reasoning Chain
```
To determine which genus of flowering plant is found in an environment further south, we need to compare the native ranges of *Crocosmia* and *Cimicifuga* (also known as *Actaea racemosa*).

1. **Crocosmia**:
   - Native to southern and eastern Africa, ranging from South Africa to Sudan.
   - One species (*Crocosmia paniculata*) is specifically native to eastern South Africa, Lesotho, and Swaziland.
   - South Africa is located in the southern hemisphere, with its southernmost point (Cape Agulhas) at approximately 34.8°S latitude.

2. **Cimicifuga (Actaea racemosa)**:
   - Native to eastern North America, from the extreme south of Ontario to central Georgia, and west to Missouri and Arkansas.
   - The southernmost point in this range is central Georgia, which is at approximately 32°N latitude.

Now, comparing the latitudes:
- The southernmost point of *Crocosmia*'s range (South Africa) is at ~34.8°S.
- The southernmost point of *Cimicifuga*'s range (Georgia) is at ~32°N.

Since latitude measures how far north or south a location is from the equator, a higher absolute latitude value (ignoring the hemisphere) indicates a further south location. Here, 34.8°S is further south than

### Reasoning Chain
```
To determine which South African anti-apartheid archbishop was part of the actions against the ruling National Party government, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Internal Resistance to Apartheid**:
   - This section mentions several key figures involved in anti-apartheid resistance, including Steve Biko, Desmond Tutu, Nelson Mandela, Harry Schwarz, and Joe Slovo.
   - It highlights that both black and white activists were involved in various anti-apartheid causes, with continuous interplay between violent and non-violent actions from the 1980s until 1994.

2. **Desmond Tutu**:
   - This section explicitly states that Desmond Tutu was a South African anti-apartheid and social rights activist and Anglican bishop.
   - It also notes that he was the first black Archbishop of Cape Town, which aligns with the title "archbishop" mentioned in the question.

3. **Democratic Party (South Africa, 1973)**:
   - This section is about a political party formed by a former National Party member and does not mention any archbishops or direct anti-apartheid actions by Desmond Tutu.

From the above, the only archbishop mentioned in the context of anti-apartheid resistance is Desmond Tutu. The other figures listed (e.g., Nelson Mandela) were not archbishops, and the Democratic Party section does not provide relevant information for this question.

**Final Answer**: Desmond

Answer: Desmond Tutu

To determine whether Jean-Paul Sartre or George Bernard Shaw had more influence on turn-of-the-century literature, we need to consider several factors, including their literary output, impact on contemporary thought, and lasting legacy. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

### 1. **Time Periods and Definitions of "Turn of the Century"**
   - The "turn of the century" typically refers to the late 19th and early 20th centuries (roughly 1880–1920).
   - George Bernard Shaw (1856–1950) was active during this period, with his major works (e.g., *Man and Superman*, *Pygmalion*) published between 1890 and 1920.
   - Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980) was born in 1905, so his major works (e.g., *Being and Nothingness*, *No Exit*) were published in the 1940s and 1950s, well after the turn of the century.

   **Conclusion**: Shaw was active during the turn of the century, while Sartre's influence came later.

### 2. **Literary and Philosophical Influence**
   - **George Bernard Shaw**:
     - A leading playwright and critic of his time, Shaw's works were influential in shaping modern drama, particularly through his wit,

Answer: George Bernard Shaw had more influence on turn-of-the-century literature.

### Reasoning Chain
```
To determine the street where SkyJump Las Vegas is located, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **SkyJump Las Vegas** is located at the **Stratosphere Las Vegas** (as mentioned in the first Wikipedia excerpt).
2. The **Trump International Hotel Las Vegas** is mentioned to be located on **Fashion Show Drive** (as stated in the third Wikipedia excerpt).
3. However, the **Stratosphere Las Vegas** (where SkyJump is located) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided excerpts to be on Fashion Show Drive. The Trump International Hotel is the one on Fashion Show Drive.

Since the question asks for the street where **SkyJump Las Vegas** is located, and the provided information does not explicitly state the street for the Stratosphere Las Vegas, we cannot definitively answer the question based solely on the given excerpts.

However, if we were to infer or assume that the Stratosphere Las Vegas is the same as the Trump International Hotel (which it is not, as they are separate properties), the answer would be **Fashion Show Drive**. But this would be incorrect because the Stratosphere Las Vegas is actually located on **Las Vegas Boulevard South** (also known as the Las Vegas Strip).

Given the information provided, the correct answer cannot be determined definitively. But based on general knowledge, the Stratosphere Las Vegas (and thus SkyJump Las Vegas) is located on **Las Vegas Boulevard South**.

**Final Answer:** Las Vegas

Answer: Las Vegas Boulevard South

To determine the language in which Giuseppe Tornatore wrote and directed his film "The Best Offer," we can analyze the information provided in the Wikipedia entries.

1. **Giuseppe Tornatore's Background**: The first entry confirms that Giuseppe Tornatore is an Italian film director and screenwriter, which suggests that his primary language is Italian. However, this does not necessarily mean all his films are in Italian.

2. **The Best Offer (La migliore offerta)**: The second entry provides specific details about "The Best Offer." It mentions that the film is titled "La migliore offerta" in Italian, which translates to "The Best Offer." Importantly, it states that the film is an "Italian English-language romantic mystery film." This indicates that the film was written and directed in English, even though it is an Italian production.

3. **Cinema Paradiso (Nuovo Cinema Paradiso)**: The third entry about "Cinema Paradiso" is included for context. It confirms that Tornatore has directed films in Italian (as "Cinema Paradiso" is in Italian), but this does not directly affect the language of "The Best Offer."

**Conclusion**: The key detail is that "The Best Offer" is explicitly described as an "Italian English-language romantic mystery film," meaning it was written and directed in English.

**Final Answer**: English.

**Question**: "The Parasite" is a kind of text that has how many words?
**Question Type**: bridge

### Answers
- **Gold Answer**: between 7,500 and 40,000
- **Predicted Answer**: 7,500–17,500 words.

- **Gold Recall**: 1.0000
- **First Retrieval Recall**: 1.0000
- **Number of Retrieval Steps**: 1

### Reasoning Chain
```
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Identify the type of text "The Parasite" is**:
   - The Wikipedia entry for "The Parasite" states that it is a "novelette" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
   - The Wikipedia entry for "Novella" defines a novella as a fictional prose text longer than a short story but shorter than a novel, typically between 7,500 and 40,000 words.
   - A "novelette" is a term sometimes used to describe a very short novel or a long short story, but it is not a standard term in literary classification. However, it is often considered a subcategory of the novella, typically shorter than a novella but longer than a short story. The word count for a novelette is often cited as between 7,500 and 17,500 words, though definitions can vary.

2. **Determine the word count range for "The Parasite"**:
   - Since "The Parasite" is a novelette, and a novelette is generally shorter than a novella, we can infer that it likely falls within the lower end of the novella range or the upper end of the short story range.
   - Given that a short story is typically under 7,500 words and a novella is between 7,500 and 40,000

Answer: 7,500–17,500 words.

   - The first Wikipedia excerpt mentions "Arkansas" as a state in the southeastern region of the United States with over 3 million people as of 2017. This matches the description in the question.

2. **Locate Downtown Bentonville within Arkansas**:
   - The second Wikipedia excerpt describes "Downtown Bentonville" as the historic business district of Bentonville, Arkansas. It is a central business district that has undergone recent transformations, including new condos, lofts, and the arrival of new businesses and residents.

3. **Determine the type of district**:
   - The excerpt explicitly states that Downtown Bentonville is the "historic business district" of Bentonville, Arkansas. It is also described as a "central business district" (CBD), which is a common term for the commercial and business center of a city.

4. **Cross-reference with the Alabama Theatre excerpt (if needed)**:
   - The Alabama Theatre excerpt is about a theater district in Birmingham, Alabama, which is unrelated to the question about Downtown Bentonville. It serves as a distractor in this context.

**Final Answer**: Downtown Bentonville is a **historic business district** (or **central business district**) in Arkansas.

1. **Identify the relevant person**:
   - The question asks about an actor born on August 17, 1993.
   - From the given Wikipedia titles, **Yoo Seung-ho** is the only person born on August 17, 1993. The other two entries (Carmelo Pace and MV Arctic Sea) are not actors and do not match the birth year.

## Question 200: 5a89810655429946c8d6e929

**Question**: How long is the river The Atherton Bridge spans?
**Question Type**: bridge

### Answers
- **Gold Answer**: 37.5
- **Predicted Answer**: The length of the river is not specified.
- **Exact Match**: ❌ (0.0000)
- **F1 Score**: 0.0000

### Retrieval
- **Retrieved Titles**: Atherton Bridge, Maiden Lane Bridge, Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop
- **First Retrieval Titles**: Atherton Bridge, Maiden Lane Bridge, Colorado River Bridge at Bastrop
- **Gold Titles**: Atherton Bridge, Nashua River
- **Gold Recall**: 0.5000
- **First Retrieval Recall**: 0.5000
- **Number of Retrieval Steps**: 1

### Reasoning Chain
```
To determine the length of the river that the Atherton Bridge spans, we need to look for information about the span length of the bridge itself, as the bridge's length typically corresponds to the distance it covers over the river.

From the provided Wikipedia excerpt about the Atherton Bridge, we have the following details:
- The Atherton Bridge is an iron truss bridge in Lancaster, Massachusetts, spanning the South Branch of the Nashua River.
- It is a hybrid pony truss bridge built in 1870 by J.H. Cofrode & Co. of Philadelphia.
- It was the first iron bridge in the town.
- It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.

However, the excerpt does not explicitly state the length of the bridge or the river it spans. The length of the river itself is not provided, and the bridge's length is also not mentioned in the given text.

Therefore, based on the information provided, we cannot determine the length of the river that the Atherton Bridge spans. Additional information or a more detailed source would be needed to answer this question accurately.

Answer: The length of the river is not specified.

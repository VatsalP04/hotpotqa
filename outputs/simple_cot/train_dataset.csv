A five-star rank with NATO code OF-10, it is equivalent to an Admiral of the Fleet in the Royal Navy or a Marshal of the Royal Air Force in the Royal Air Force (RAF).  A Field Marshal's insignia consists of two crossed batons surrounded by yellow leaves below St Edward's Crown.  Like Marshals of the RAF and Admirals of the Fleet, Field Marshals traditionally remain officers for life, though on half-pay when not in an appointment.  The rank has been used sporadically throughout its history and was vacant during parts of the 18th and 19th centuries (when all former holders of the rank were deceased).  After the Second World War, it became standard practice to appoint the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (later renamed Chief of the General Staff) to the rank on his last day in the post.  Army officers occupying the post of Chief of the Defence Staff, the professional head of all the British Armed Forces, were usually promoted to the rank upon their appointment."

The campaign is preceded by “The Man Your Man Could Smell Like"" which was a television advertising campaign by Wieden+Kennedy for Old Spice.  The ""Make a Smellmitment"" campaign retains much of the format from the previous campaign including its characters played by Isaiah Mustafa and Terry Crews.  The content of the new campaign ads also consist of character monologues during long single shots while engaging in random activities and addressing the female audience.  The inaugural commercial, titled “And So It Begins”, lasts 1:02 minutes and introduces returning Old Spice actors Isaiah Mustafa as well as Terry Crews.  This advertising campaign markets Wild Collection Bearglove Men’s Body Wash and Timber Bar Soap.  Isaiah Mustafa and Terry Crews returned in their recurring roles from previous Old Spice advertisements.  Mustafa’s character (referred to as the “Old Spice Man”) continues to target women despite marketing hygiene products for men as it was determined that women often buy household products for men.  Terry Crews also reprised his Old Spice character that targets the male audience as he is always screaming and breaking things.  The theme of the campaign focuses on the contrast between the smooth-talking monologues by Isaiah Mustafa and screaming Terry Crews interrupting each other as they advertise Old Spice Timber and Bearglove respectively.  The commercials usually end with the two men each holding up their respective products side by side and pointing at them with Crews repeatedly yelling “Bearglove!”  and Mustafa eventually saying “stop it”.  ""The point of it is more than just bringing two guys together.  It's about helping people who think about or use Old Spice pick the scent that best fits their personality by connecting scents with the personalities of Isaiah and Terry"", said John Sebastian, marketing director for Old Spice."

As the population and the needs of the school have changed, so have the dimensions of the school.  A new addition/renovation was added to the facility in the fall of 2001 providing state-of-the-art career and technical education opportunities.  This addition consisted of a broadcasting studio, a bio-technology lab, a communication technology center, a computer-assisted drafting lab, and three classrooms.  Patrick Henry celebrated its 50th anniversary in September 2009.  Patrick Henry High has an International Baccalaureate program, as well as a NJROTC program.  Patrick Henry High is especially known for its NJROTC program that is consistently ranked among the top in the state of Virginia.  During the 2010-2011 school year, a program called Rachel's Challenge was introduced.

Broadly defined, it was a way of structuring society around relationships derived from the holding of land in exchange for service or labour.","In Russian history, Mestnichestvo (Russian: Ме́стничество , ] ; from ме́сто, a position) was a feudal hierarchical system in Russia from the 15th to 17th centuries.  ""Mestnichestvo"" was a complicated system of seniority which dictated which government posts a ""boyar"" could occupy.  It was based on the individual's seniority within an extended Russian aristocratic family on the one hand, and on the order of precedence of the families, on the other.  The hierarchy of families was calculated based on the historical records of senior appointments, going back to 1475.  For example, the Odoevskys clan was ranked higher than the Buturlins, but a senior Buturlin could be appointed to a position equivalent to that occupied by a junior member of the Odoevsky family.  The mestnichestvo seniority system was most visibly represented in the order of seating of the boyars at the tsar's table.  The clans jealously guarded their status.  This often led to bitter disputes and physical violence among nobles about their ancestry and their services to the monarch.  According to eminent Russian 19th century historian Vasily Klyuchevsky, ""you could beat a boyar up, you could take away his property, you could expel him from government service, but you could never make him accept an appointment or a seat at the tsar's table lower than what he is entitled to."""

Since the introduction of Wolverine by Marvel Comics in 1974 and inspired by the immense popularity of the character, superhuman healing has become a fairly common power featured in comic books, novels, television, film, and other media.  The overall efficiency of a character's healing factor often fluctuates due to various writers applying a very broad degree of artistic license.  Weapon X has been established, on multiple accounts for having the fastest healing factor over all mutants, with the exception of external factors.  As a result, especially concerning characters depicted in comic books, it has become a very common source of debate among fans.  Over the years, it has also become common for healing factors to have an umbrella effect, serving as a partial source for multiple superhuman abilities; various powers thus demonstrated include superhuman strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, durability and/or senses, to name the most common.  The source of a character's healing factor, depending upon the medium, usually ranges from natural genetic mutation, accidental exposure to radioactive materials, artificially-induced genetic enhancement, cybernetic augmentation, magic or even a combination of different factors.  Despite the ability to quickly recover from wounds, characters with a healing factor are still capable of feeling pain.","A quantum field effect transistor (QFET) is a kind of field-effect transistor that takes advantage of quantum tunneling to greatly increase the speed of transistor operation by eliminating the traditional transistor's area of electron conduction which typically causes carriers to slow down by a factor of 3000.

The state was founded as a result of the unification of Italy under the influence of the Kingdom of Sardinia, which can be considered its legal predecessor state.","Italy, as a single nation state, began only in 1861, after the Piedmont-based Kingdom of Sardinia conquered most of present-day Italy.  At that point, titles were recognized to all who held them according to the law of so-called ""pre-unitarian"" States.  Consequently, the Kingdom of Italy had several different nobility traditions, one for each pre-unitarian State and one for the unified state (that was actually the Piedmontese-Savoyard one).  That is why the Italian College of Arms, called ""Consulta araldica"" (heraldic council), was organized in 14 ""regional"" commissions.  Common rules concerning all titles were established only in 1926.  That is why a list of Italian marquisates has to be divided into different pre-unitarian lists, plus a unified list for titles granted after 1861.  The latter should be completed with titles granted by the last King of Italy, Humbert II, during his exile and after the proclamation of the republic (1946), until his death in 1983: these concessions base upon the fact that he was not defeated in war and thus remained a king, that is a ""fons honorum"", but this issue is controversial, titles granted by a non-reigning king not being recognized by most noble and royal families in Europe.  Only the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and the Corpo della Nobiltà Italiana recognize these titles, while the CILANE treats them as mere titles of courtesy."

William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, is believed to have bred Alpine Mastiffs at Chatsworth House.","The English Mastiff is a breed of extremely large dog (often known simply as the Mastiff) perhaps descended from the ancient Alaunt and Pugnaces Britanniae, with a significant input from the Alpine Mastiff in the 19th century.  Distinguishable by enormous size, massive head, and a limited range of colours, but always displaying a black mask, the Mastiff is noted for its gentle and loving nature.  The lineage of modern dogs can be traced back to the early 19th century, but the modern type was stabilised in the 1880s and refined since.  Following a period of sharp decline, the Mastiff has increased its worldwide popularity.  Throughout its history, the Mastiff has contributed to the development of a number of dog breeds, some generally known as Mastiff-type dogs, or, confusingly, just as ""Mastiffs""."
